# Absolute-Permutation-algo It tries to create a permutation of numbers from 1 to n such that the absolute difference between each numberâ€™s position and its value is exactly k. The function absolutePermutation (currently empty) will include the logic to either build and return that valid sequence or output -1 if no such arrangement is possible.
